## üîç About My Repositories

I craft solutions ranging from simple utilities to complex applications. Unfortunately, many of my most interesting projects are in private repositories for clients and companies I've worked with. However, what you'll find public here represents my coding style and problem-solving approach.

The public repositories show:
- Clean architectural patterns
- Thoughtful documentation (when I remember to write it)
- Solutions to real-world problems

## ü§ù Let's Talk Code!

If you have an interesting idea, want to collaborate on a project, or simply chat about the latest framework we should all be learning, reach out!
